**Size:** Denotes which characters can use this type of weapon.

### Ammunition

| Ammunition            | Cost (gp) |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| Arrows (quiver of 20) | 5         |
| Quarrels (case of 20) | 10        |

### Qualities

**Armour piercing:** +2 Attack against targets wearing non-magical metal armour.

**Brace:** When attacking a target that charged into melee with the wielder this
Round, inflicts double damage due to bracing the weapon against the ground.

**Charge:** Charge attacks from a suitable mount (see Horses and Vehicles,
p120), double any damage inflicted.

**Melee:** Close quarters weapon, only usable within 5′ of an opponent.

**Missile:** Thrown or fired weapon, only usable at greater than 5′ from an
opponent. The distances for short (+1 Attack), medium, and long (–1 Attack)
range are shown in parentheses.

**Reach:** Can be used to attack from the second rank, from behind one or more
allies in front. Incurs a –2 Attack penalty if the ally in front is of equal
size or larger than the wielder or is using a two-handed weapon.

**Reload:** Can only be fired once every 2 Rounds, requiring a Round to reload
between shots.

**Splash:** On a successful attack, the container smashes and douses the target
with the liquid. The listed damage is inflicted for 2 Rounds, as the liquid
drips off.

**Two-handed:** Requires both hands to wield. The character cannot carry
anything (e.g. a shield) in the other hand. Uses 2 slots.

### Special Metals

Adventurers in Dolmenwood sometimes seek out weapons forged of cold iron or
silver, as those metals are harmful to fairies or certain undead monsters.

**Time:** Cold iron and silver weapons must be crafted to special order,
incurring a delay of 2d6 days.

### Cold Iron Weapons

**Cost:** Double the weapon’s normal price.

**Damage:** Cold iron weapons gain a +1 damage bonus against fairies and
demi-fey, but suffer a –1 damage penalty against other creatures. For example, a
cold iron shortsword inflicts 1d6+1 damage on a fairy or demi-fey (rather than
the standard 1d6) and 1d6–1 damage against other creatures.

**Construction:** Cold iron weapons are made of pure iron, forged in flames of
ancient yew wood, and doused in water infused with mandrake root.

### Silver Weapons

**Cost:** Ten times the weapon’s normal price.

**Damage:** Silver weapons inflict normal damage on all foes, but certain foes
can only be harmed by silver (or magic) weapons.

## Armour

| Armour     | Cost (gp) | AC | Slots | Bulk   |
| ---------- | --------- | -- | ----- | ------ |
| Unarmoured | -         | 10 | -     | None   |
| Leather    | 20        | 12 | 1     | Light  |
| Bark       | 30        | 13 | 2     | Medium |
| Chainmail  | 40        | 14 | 2     | Medium |
| Pinecone   | 50        | 15 | 3     | Heavy  |
| Plate mail | 60        | 16 | 3     | Heavy  |
| Full plate | 1000      | 17 | 3     | Heavy  |
| Shield     | 10        | 1  | 1     | None   |

**Bark armour:** Thick layers of tough, lichen-encrusted bark, with flexible
joints of young birch bark or bottle corks laced together. Typically only
available in small size, designed for mosslings.

**Chainmail:** A suit of interlocking metal rings over a back- ing of quilted
fabric.

**Full plate armour:** Perfectly interlocking plates of metal over a backing of
chain mail and padding. Only the most expert armourers can craft full plate
armour, and each suit must be tailored and balanced for a specific individ- ual
(takes 1 month). Wearing another person’s full plate armour is awkward and only
grants AC 16.

**Leather armour:** A breastplate of hardened leather, with soft leather
covering the rest of the body.

**Pinecone armour:** An intricate scale-work of hardened pine scales threaded
onto a cloth backing. Typically only available in small size, designed for
mosslings.

**Plate mail:** Metal plates shaped to the contours of the body. Sections of
chainmail provide flexibility at the joints.

**Shield:** Made of metal or reinforced wood.

**Unarmoured:** Standard clothing.

### Tailoring Armour

**Custom crafting:** If armour suited to a character’s size is not available for
purchase, an armourer may be able to craft custom-fitted armour. This has no
extra cost, but it takes 2d6 days.

**Adapting armour:** An armourer can adapt an exist- ing suit of armour to a
character of different size. This process takes 2d6 days and costs half the
armour’s full price. For example, tailoring a suit of human-sized chainmail to
fit a woodgrue would cost 20gp.
