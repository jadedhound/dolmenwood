## Sentient Folk

While humans dominate the settled reaches of Dolmenwood, they
are not the only folk to call the place home. 

### Breggles 

The High Wold region of
south-western Dolmenwood has been ruled since ancient times by the goat-headed
breg- gles. Breggles divide themselves into two castes, distin- guished by the
length of their horns—the aristocratic longhorns and the commoner shorthorns.

### Mosslings 

The dank, fungal-infested lowlands of Mulchgrove, in the eastern
woods, are home to a shy and stunted folk called mosslings, part mortal flesh
and part plant or fungus. 

### Fairies and Demi-Fey Among the myriad peoples of
Fairy, a number venture into Dolmenwood and mingle with mortal folk: elves,
otherworldly and beautiful, the little cat-folk known as grimalkins, and
bat-faced woodgrues are the most commonly encountered. 

### Other Sentient Beings 

If
one ventures off the beaten track in Dolmenwood, innumerable creatures await
discovery. Goblin tricksters peddle fairy fruits and other questionable wares;
scrabies emerge from their network of tunnels, eager to explore; even a bird or
animal may surprise travellers by greeting them from the wayside, spinning a
riddle, or cursing their trespass. 

## Factions and Powers 

### The Duchy of Brackenwold

Ruling from the supposedly impregnable Castle Bracken- wold on the south-eastern
verge of the forest, the Dukes of Brackenwold trace their line back to the
earliest settlers in the region. All mortal folk within the Wood—from the
humblest beggar to the highest lord—pay fealty to the duke. The whole forest is
his property. 

### The Pluritine Church 

The monotheistic Pluritine Church dominates
throughout Dolmenwood and beyond. While it holds much political clout, the
Church is of late diminished in Dolmenwood. Many shrines and chapels that once
saw regular worship have fallen into ruin and been reclaimed by the forest. Some
within the Church seek to rediscover and re-sanctify these lost shrines. The
Cold Prince Where mortals now reign, great fairy nobles once held court. The
entirety of Dolmenwood was once the domain of a cruel elf lord known as the Cold
Prince, lord of winter eternal, who ruled from the palace of Hoarblight Keep
overlooking the great Lake Longmere. When humans began to settle the wild glades
a great war between fairy and mortal ensued. Mortals eventually prevailed and
the Cold Prince was banished to his domain in Fairy. Fearful tales of his return
to Dolmenwood and his icy wrath weave a common thread through the folklore of
those who dwell within his erstwhile domain. The Nag-Lord A wicked, trickster
figure of local folklore, said to keep unholy court in the twisted northern
woods, where his armies of corrupted breggles and other creatures of Chaos lair.
The Nag-Lord is known in folktales as the “King of the Wood,” and is portrayed
as being part man, part unicorn, with nine legs (nine being regarded as an
especially accursed number). The Drune A cabal of sorcerers who roam the Wood,
cloaked in black. They claim the magical energies of Dolmenwood and what gods
they worship is a matter of conjecture, for they guard their secrets with their
lives. In the eyes of the Church they are heathens to be eradicated, for it is
said they deal in devil worship and human sacrifice. Kidnap by the Drune is
among the greatest fears of the simple folk of Dolmen- wood, who refer to the
cult as “the Hooded Men,” fearing to speak the word “Drune.” The Witches Mortal
women who worship ancient deities in the forbid- den depths of Dolmenwood. Their
aims are obscure, but it is known that they gather beneath the moon to work
magic. In folklore, witches are variously portrayed as depraved practitioners of
human sacrifice, treacherous wielders of hex and illusion, and ministers of
potent cures and charms. Ygraine the Sorceress A reclusive figure said to be the
most powerful magi- cian in Dolmenwood, Ygraine dwells in the many-tiered
Chateau Mauvesse, overlooking the black waters of the Dark Mirror. It is
rumoured that her explorations of other- worldly realms have brought her into
contact with the Cold Prince and that she now works her magic to release him
from exile.


## The World

### The World of Fairy
The timeless world of Fairy—the native world of elves
and grimalkins, where magic permeates all things—lies
parallel to the mortal world. In Dolmenwood, the veil
between the two worlds is thin, and magical doorways
and roads allow fairies to slip into the mortal world.

Castle Brackenwold The seat of the Duchy of Brackenwold and ancestral home to
the nobility of the line, Castle Brackenwold perches upon a high hill with a
city stretched at its feet. Alongside the mighty ducal garrison is a great
cathedral—the seat of the Church’s power in Dolmenwood. Dreg and Shantywood Isle
A port and fishing village beside the River Hameth. Dreg has a seedy reputation
as a haunt for thieves, gamblers, and rascals of all stripes, only worsened by
its proximity to Shantywood Isle, a notorious port of ill-repute. Dreg is also
famed for its fine bog-swine sausages. Fort Vulgar A crude keep overlooking a
port at the northern end of Lake Longmere. Fort Vulgar is ruled by Sir Osric the
Gaunt, a vassal of the Duke of Brackenwold who is responsible for the taxation
of all traffic via the port. Hag’s Addle A shunned region of mazy swampland
around the banks of the River Hameth, haunted by the sinister Hag. It is said
that she glimpses into the past and future and resurrects the dead, but the
price she demands in return is perilous. High-Hankle The second largest town in
Dolmenwood (after Castle Brackenwold), High-Hankle is the ancient capital of the
High Wold region, now reputed for revelry, carousing, and debauchery of every
flavour. At its centre stands the impos- ing Castle Perigonne, home of the Baron
Hogwarsh. The High Wold A barony encompassing the south-western corner of
Dolmenwood, ruled in tandem by breggle and human noble houses. The barony has
become wild of late under the lax rule of Baron Hogwarsh: highwaymen hunt the
roads and charlatans peddle questionable wares. Lake Longmere The great Lake
Longmere, at the centre of Dolmenwood, is twelve miles broad at its widest
point. No ships ply its waters, and locals speak fearfully of lake monsters.
Lankshorn The market town of Lankshorn, ruled by the breggle aris- tocracy, lies
within a bowshot of the forest’s border. In Lankshorn, the traditions of the
civilised south meld with the quaint, superstitious ways of Dolmenwood.

Mulchgrove The central region of the Wood is a dank lowland riddled with fungal
forests, treacherous bogs, and twisted willow- woods. The region is little
traversed save by sentient fungal monstrosities and the native mosslings, at
home amongst the dew-kissed fungi and moulds. The Nagwood The northern woods,
corrupted by the presence of the court of the wicked Nag-Lord and his foul
armies. None of sound mind venture within this twisted region of evil. Prigwort
The market town of Prigwort is the largest settlement beneath the forest’s
eaves. Famed for its breweries and distilleries, Prigwort is ruled by a council
known as the Brewmasters. Connoisseurs across the land covet the fine spirits of
Prigwort. The Ruined Abbey of St Clewyd East of Lake Longmere, in the depths of
Dolmenwood, a great monastery was founded of old. The abbey has lain in ruins
for a century following a nocturnal assault of unknown provenance. The Witching
Ring In the western reaches of Dolmenwood is found a vast ring of frost-rimed
stones, erected by the ancients for purpose long forgotten. The folk of
Dolmenwood name them the “Summerstones” and the great ring which they inscribe
the “Witching Ring.” The Woodcutters’ Encampment Once a mere woodcutters’ camp,
the village is now a thriv- ing trade community. The locals practice unusual
arts of woodcraft and are said to show no fear of the Drune.
